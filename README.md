Hey there, I'm Dominik, an experienced Product Designer with a strong focus on minimal but joy-sparking solutions to complex problems. I have a **keen interest in the synergy between development and design**, along with a **focus on DesignOps**. Committed to continuous learning and refining both my personal and professional skills.

Currently Iâ€™m working as a **Product Designer** at [karriere.at](https://karriere.at). Previously I worked in different Roles at [Blockpit](https://blockpit.io) and [Storyclash](https://storyclash.com).
